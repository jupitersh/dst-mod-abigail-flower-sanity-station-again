# Abigail Flower Sanity Station Again

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Since the rework of Wendy, Aligail Flower can no longer turn into flower.

So the mod was developed to make that happen again.

## Changelog

**Version 1.2.0**

- Now Abigial Flower cannot turn into flower in the same position(the same as the old version).

**Version 1.1.0**

- Use the component of "timer" instead of "DoTaskInTime" so that the Abigail Flower decay time will continue after server reboot.
- Abigail Flower now will turn into flower on certain turfs like the older version.
- Evil Flower become fireproof and can't be picked but can be removed by shovel with 3 times of digging.
